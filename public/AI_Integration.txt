1.Which model/framework you'd choose and why?

  If I had to choose a model or framework, I’d go with Gemini AI by Google DeepMind.
  What makes Gemini really stand out to me is its ability to handle multiple types of input—like
  text, images, audio, and even code—all in one model. That kind of flexibility is super useful,
  especially when working on projects that mix different formats.

  Plus, because it’s backed by Google, it integrates smoothly with tools I already use,
  like Google Cloud, Colab, or Android development platforms. That kind of ecosystem support makes
  development faster and more convenient.

2.How you would integrate it into a Next.js app?

  Step 1: Get API Access (getting API_KEY and storing in .env.local file)

  Step 2: Create an API Route in Next.js (Use POST to send user prompts and 
          GET if needed to retrieve preset or stored content.)

  Step 3: Connect from Your Frontend ( In your frontend, create a form or input to capture
          user prompts. Use fetch to send the prompt to your API route and display the Gemini AI
          response.)

3.How you'd handle input/output and streaming responses

  To handle user input, I would use a controlled form element in the React frontend. 
  The user's message would be captured using a useState hook and then sent to a Next.js API route
  using a POST request.

  The response from Gemini AI is received on the server side and sent back to the frontend as JSON.
  On the frontend, I display the AI’s response inside a div tag.

  Streaming adds real-time interactivity and can be achieved using ReadableStream or server-sent
  events if the model and environment support it.
